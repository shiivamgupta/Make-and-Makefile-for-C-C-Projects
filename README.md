# Make-and-Makefile-for-C-C-Projects

# Explanation:- 

1. `DEBUG ?= 1`: This line sets the value of the variable `DEBUG` to 1 if it is not already defined. This variable is used later to determine whether to build the executable in debug mode or release mode.

2. `ENABLE_WARNINGS ?= 1`: Similarly, this line sets the value of the variable `ENABLE_WARNINGS` to 1 if it is not already defined. It controls whether compiler warnings should be enabled or not.

3. `WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS ?= 0`: This line sets the value of the variable `WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` to 0 if it is not already defined. It determines whether compiler warnings should be treated as errors.

4. `INCLUDE_DIR = include`: Sets the value of the `INCLUDE_DIR` variable to "include", which represents the directory containing header files.

5. `SOURCE_DIR = src`: Sets the value of the `SOURCE_DIR` variable to "src", which represents the directory containing source code files.

6. `BUILD_DIR = build`: Sets the value of the `BUILD_DIR` variable to "build", which represents the directory where object files and the final executable will be placed.

7. `ifeq ($(ENABLE_WARNINGS), 1)`: This is a conditional statement that checks if the value of the `ENABLE_WARNINGS` variable is 1. If it is, the following block of code will be executed, otherwise skipped.

8. `CXX_WARNINGS = -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`: This line sets the value of the `CXX_WARNINGS` variable to a set of compiler warning flags. These flags enable various types of warning messages during compilation.

9. `else`: This keyword denotes the alternative block of code to be executed if the condition in the preceding `ifeq` statement is not satisfied.

10. `CXX_WARNINGS =`: This line sets the `CXX_WARNINGS` variable to an empty value. This means that the compiler warnings will be disabled.

11. `endif`: This keyword marks the end of the conditional statement block.

12. `ifeq ($(WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS), 1)`: This is another conditional statement that checks if the value of the `WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` variable is 1. If it is, the following block of code will be executed, otherwise skipped.

13. `CXX_WARNINGS += -Werror`: This line appends the flag `-Werror` to the `CXX_WARNINGS` variable. This flag treats compiler warnings as errors, causing the compilation to fail if any warning is encountered.

14. `endif`: Marks the end of the conditional statement block.

15. `CXX_STANDARD = c++17`: Sets the value of the `CXX_STANDARD` variable to "c++17", indicating that the C++17 language standard should be used during compilation.

16. `CXX = g++`: Specifies the C++ compiler to be used, which in this case is `g++`.

17. `CXXFLAGS = $(CXX_WARNINGS) -std=$(CXX_STANDARD)`: Sets the value of the `CXXFLAGS` variable to the compiler flags to be used during compilation. It includes the warning flags (`CXX_WARNINGS`) and the C++ standard flag (`-std=$(CXX_STANDARD)`).

18. `CPPFLAGS = -I $(INCLUDE_DIR)`: Sets the value of the `CPPFLAGS` variable to the preprocessor flags. In this case, it includes the `-I` flag followed by the `INCLUDE_DIR` directory, which adds the directory to the search path for header files.

19. `LDFLAGS =`: Sets the value of the `LDF

LAGS` variable to an empty value. This variable can be used to specify linker flags if needed.

20. `ifeq ($(DEBUG), 1)`: This conditional statement checks if the value of the `DEBUG` variable is 1. If it is, the following block of code will be executed, otherwise skipped.

21. `CXXFLAGS += -g -O0`: This line appends the flags `-g` (debug information) and `-O0` (no optimization) to the `CXXFLAGS` variable. These flags are used during compilation in debug mode.

22. `EXECUTABLE_NAME = mainDebug`: Sets the value of the `EXECUTABLE_NAME` variable to "mainDebug". This is the name of the executable that will be generated in debug mode.

23. `else`: Marks the alternative block of code to be executed if the condition in the preceding `ifeq` statement is not satisfied.

24. `CXXFLAGS += -O3`: This line appends the flag `-O3` (maximum optimization) to the `CXXFLAGS` variable. This flag is used during compilation in release mode.

25. `EXECUTABLE_NAME = mainRelease`: Sets the value of the `EXECUTABLE_NAME` variable to "mainRelease". This is the name of the executable that will be generated in release mode.

26. `endif`: Marks the end of the conditional statement block.

27. `CXX_COMPILER_CALL = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS)`: Defines the `CXX_COMPILER_CALL` variable to hold the complete compiler invocation command. It includes the compiler (`CXX`), compiler flags (`CXXFLAGS`), and preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`).

28. `CXX_SOURCES = $(wildcard $(SOURCE_DIR)/*.cc)`: Sets the `CXX_SOURCES` variable to a list of C++ source files in the `SOURCE_DIR` directory. The `wildcard` function is used to match all files with the ".cc" extension.

29. `CXX_OBJECTS = $(patsubst $(SOURCE_DIR)/%.cc, $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o, $(CXX_SOURCES))`: Sets the `CXX_OBJECTS` variable to a list of corresponding object files derived from the source files. The `patsubst` function is used to replace the source directory path with the build directory path and change the file extension from ".cc" to ".o".

30. `all: create build`: This is the default target that will be built when `make` is invoked without any specific target. It depends on the "create" and "build" targets, which will be explained later.

31. `create:`
    - `@mkdir -p build`: This line creates the `build` directory using the `mkdir` command. The `-p` flag ensures that the directory is created only if it doesn't already exist. The `@` symbol at the beginning of the line prevents the command itself from being printed in the output.

32. `build: $(CXX_OBJECTS)`: This target depends on the `CXX_OBJECTS` variable (object files) and is responsible for linking the object files into the final executable.

33. `$(CXX_COMPILER_CALL) $(CXX_OBJECTS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(BUILD_DIR)/$(EXECUTABLE_NAME)`: This line invokes the compiler command (`CXX_COMPILER_CALL`) with the object files, linker flags (`LDFLAGS`), and the output file name. It produces the final executable file in the `BUILD_DIR` directory.

34. `execute:`:
    - `./$(BUILD_DIR)/$(EXECUTABLE

_NAME)`: This line executes the generated executable by running the `$(EXECUTABLE_NAME)` file located in the `BUILD_DIR` directory.

35. `clean:`:
    - `rm -f $(BUILD_DIR)/*.o`: This line removes all object files (`*.o`) from the `BUILD_DIR` directory using the `rm` command.
    - `rm -f $(BUILD_DIR)/$(EXECUTABLE_NAME)`: This line removes the generated executable file from the `BUILD_DIR` directory.

36. `.PHONY: create build execute clean`: This line declares the targets `create`, `build`, `execute`, and `clean` as phony targets. Phony targets are not associated with actual files and will be executed regardless of the existence of files with the same names.
